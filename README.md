🌐I have been a part of the research group at my university called Green IT for over 2 years. The main objective is to raise awareness through academic activities about the efficient use of energy and environmental consciousness. During my time there, I managed to develop an information management system using the open-source software DSpace to address a challenge faced by the research group.

Thanks to my confidence and dedication, I am part of an exclusive group of multi-signers in 3 Multisig setups on different blockchains such as Polygon, Ethereum, and Avalanche. In these setups, community funds are managed within a web 3.0 community on Twitch. Every day, we are learning about new technologies in the blockchain space. 🌐
